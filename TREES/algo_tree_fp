# Algorithm for Inserting a Node

**Start**

1. Prompt the user to enter the data for the new node.
2. Call the `insertNode` function with the root of the BST and the entered data.
3. Update the root of the BST with the result of the `insertNode` function call.
4. End

# Algorithm for Inorder Traversal

**Start**

1. Call the `inorder` function with the root of the BST.
2. Print the data of each node visited during the traversal.
3. End

# Algorithm for Preorder Traversal

**Start**

1. Call the `preorder` function with the root of the BST.
2. Print the data of each node visited during the traversal.
3. End

# Algorithm for Postorder Traversal

**Start**

1. Call the `postorder` function with the root of the BST.
2. Print the data of each node visited during the traversal.
3. End

# Algorithm for Level Order Traversal (Improved Display)

**Start**

1. Call the `printTree` function with the root of the BST.
2. Print the data of each node visited during the traversal, level by level.
3. End

# Algorithm for Searching for a Key

**Start**

1. Prompt the user to enter the key to search for.
2. Call the `search` function with the root of the BST and the entered key.
3. Print a message indicating whether the key was found in the tree.
4. End

# Algorithm for Deleting a Node

**Start**

1. Prompt the user to enter the key of the node to delete.
2. Call the `deleteNode` function with the root of the BST and the entered key.
3. Update the root of the BST with the result of the `deleteNode` function call.
4. Print a message indicating that the key has been deleted from the tree.
5. End

# Algorithm for Deleting the Entire Tree

**Start**

1. Call the `deleteTree` function with the root of the BST.
2. Reset the root of the BST to `NULL`.
3. Print a message indicating that the tree has been deleted.
4. End

# Main Menu Loop

**Start**

1. Display the main menu options to the user.
2. Read the user's choice.
3. Based on the user's choice, perform the corresponding operation.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until the user chooses to exit.
5. Ensure the tree is deleted before exiting.
6. End
