Here are the Observation which i noted while making all the codes in this repository
lot to do 
collaboration in observations is invited

1) Removing ";" after declaring a variable of certain data type
                - error: expected ';' before '_data_type_'
                -
2) Changing the names of predefind built in functions like printf,scanf.
                 - warning: implicit declaration of function 'Printf'; did you mean 'printf'? [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
